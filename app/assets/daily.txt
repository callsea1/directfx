 Forex Market Update

This morning, the greenback is trading mixed against most of the major currencies, after declining on Friday as weak US housing data added to uncertainty over when the Federal Reserve would start unwinding monetary stimulus.

Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve officials ended their annual conference at Jackson Hole and remained determined to begin scaling back one of their major economic stimulus programs but remained divided over the timing of the changes.

The Euro closed higher last week buoyed by inspiring economic data from the Euro-zone countries, thus adding to indications that the recession in the region is finally coming to an end. These encouraging economic numbers also led to more upbeat comments from the region's central bankers last week.

However, the common currency came under pressure, after the members of Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right People of Freedom (PDL) party in Italy warned over weekend that they would force early elections if their coalition allies voted next month to expel the former premier over a tax fraud conviction.

Meanwhile, the EU economic affairs commissioner, Olli Rehn, stated that new measures to reduce France's budget deficit must come from public spending cuts and raising taxes further could hamper growth and cost jobs in France.

The Pound is trading marginally higher against the greenback in thin trade today with markets in the UK closed for a holiday.

 Forex Market Update

The US Dollar failed to garner traction against the EUR and the GBP in today’s trading session, as an unexpected surge in US jobless claims last week prompted traders to shun the safe haven currency, taking some steam out of expectations that the Federal Reserve would taper monetary stimulus in September.

However, the Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher, opined that the US economy is “moving in the right direction” and is strong enough for slowing the current pace of asset purchases.

Later today, the US new home sales data is expected to grab market attention. Also, the Jackson Hole conference would be the major driver event.

The Euro rose higher underpinned by improved risk appetite amid improving prospects for the German economy, as data released this morning showed that the economy sharply rebounded in the second quarter, backed by a pickup in investment and robust consumption.

Moreover, the European Central Bank (ECB) Governing Council Member, Ewald Nowotny, opined that a recent “stream of good news” from the Euro-area economy has removed any need to cut the central bank's key interest rates.

Meanwhile, UK economic growth accelerated more than initially estimated in the second quarter, helped by construction and manufacturing activity, providing strong support to Sterling investors. To add to the positive tone, business investment in the UK rose more-than-expected in the last quarter.

Forex Market Update

The US Dollar is trading higher, after it seesawed against most of the major peers in Asian session as traders wrap up with more data from the US for the Federal Reserve’s consideration of tapering monetary stimulus. 

In a notable comment, the Fed President of St. Louis, James Bullard floated the idea that the central bank could hedge its bets by making smaller cuts in bond buying rather than large, aggressive ones when it starts pulling back on its $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program.

Initially the USD rose, after consumer prices advanced rising in July, pushing the annual inflation rate closer to the Fed’s target, while new claims for jobless benefits fell to the lowest level since late 2007. However, lackluster industrial production data and regional manufacturing indices dented investor confidence and dragged the greenback lower.

 Forex Market Update

As the calendar completes half August and approaches the crucial month of September, speculation continue to rise as to when the Federal Reserve will begin its initiative to scale back bond buying purchases.

Yesterday, the St. Louis Fed President, James Bullard, indicated that the low inflation rate in the US is a worrisome sign for the country's economy.

Forex Market Update

This morning, the greenback is trading higher against most of the major currencies, amid expectations that US could signal an early scaling back of monetary stimulus.

With not much on the US economic calendar ahead today, traders are expected to monitor the US monthly budget statement to be released by the Financial Management Service which summarizes the financial activities of federal entities and Fed banks.

The Euro slipped below the 1.3300 level after the German weekly magazine, Der Spiegel over the weekend reported that the nations’ central bank expects Greece would need extra financial aid at the beginning of 2014. The report further added that European governments will agree on a new aid program for Greece after the German election in September and no later than.

However, data released this morning showed that the Greek economy fell 4.6% in the second quarter of 2013, against the expectation of a 4.8% drop and compared to a 5.6% drop recorded in the previous quarter. Following the release of better-than-expected Greek GDP, the German finance ministry stated that a second debt haircut is not on the table.

Separately, over the weekend, the Swiss National Bank Vice President, Jean-Pierre Danthine, stated that the central bank would abolish its Franc ceiling once it starts raising interest rates.

Forex Market Update
This morning, the greenback is trading mixed against most of the major currencies.
The Euro came under pressure, following the release of uninspiring economic data across the Europe. Data indicated that service sector activity in most of the key regions in the Euro-zone remained in the contraction territory in May.

Moreover, the Euro-zone gross domestic product declined 0.2% in the first quarter, keeping the bloc in a recession for the sixth consecutive quarter of economic contraction.
The British Pound inched up after purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for measuring service sector activity in the UK expanded at the fastest rate since March 2012 in May.
The Japanese Yen registered gains, after the Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe today unveiled plans to achieve growth of 2% per year over the next decade through a series of economic reforms.
The Australian Dollar lost ground against the USD, after nation’s first quarter GDP expanded slower-than-expected, supporting case for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to cut borrowing costs. Chinese growth concerns also weighed on the currency after services activity in China rose marginally in May.
Today’s ADP employment change data from the US is expected to stir much of the movement in the market as investors would keep a tab on the data to speculate the future stance of the Federal Reserve in deciding whether to pull back its monetary easing or not.

Weekly Forex Update

The greenback held an upper hand against its key counterparts, as uninspiring data from China early in the week rattled market sentiment. Chinese economic growth slowed unexpectedly in the first quarter of 2013, while industrial production came in lower than expected. Also, Moody's lowered China's credit outlook to 'Stable' from 'Positive', citing lack of necessary progress in reducing risks from local-government debt and credit expansion.

The gains in the Dollar were capped, after the Minneapolis Fed President, Narayana Kocherlakota, and the Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve (Fed), Janet Yellen, voiced support for continuation of monetary easing program. Meanwhile, economic data in the US was mixed.

The Euro started the week lower, as disappointing economic data from China dented investor sentiment. Additionally, reports that German political party, known as the Alternative for Germany, which intends to take Germany out of the Euro, is gaining support, further pushed the Euro lower. Also, the IMF forecasted the region's economy to shrink more than projected earlier. The Euro tumbled further, on back of dovish comments by the Bundesbank President, Jens Weidmann, that there was a possibility of an interest rate cut in the Euro-zone. However, losses were trimmed, after he indicated at end of the week that rate cuts were only possible if economic data prompted it. Separately, over the weekend, the European Central Bank (ECB) President, Mario Draghi, stated that economic situation in the Euro-zone has not improved since the central bank's meeting held on 4th April.

The UK Pound declined against the greenback, amid weak unemployment data from the UK. The Bank of England's (BoE) minutes revealed that policymakers remained divided on extending the quantitative easing (QE) program. Additionally, retail sales in the UK showed disappointing numbers, thus pushing the Pound lower. Meanwhile, Fitch has downgraded UK's credit rating to 'AA+' from 'AAA', citing weaker economic and fiscal outlook.

Among the Asian currencies, the Yen traded higher earlier in the week, after economic indicators showed that trade deficit in Japan narrowed in March. However, the gains were reversed, after Japan received G-20 support on its current monetary policy.

The commodity sensitive Canadian Dollar witnessed drop in the last week, after the Bank of Canada (BoC) trimmed its forecast for the nation's economy. The Australian Dollar suffered losses earlier in the weak, amid poor Chinese GDP and industrial production data. However, it gave up its losses in the latter part of the week, buoyed by upbeat domestic economic data.

EUR USD

Last week, the EUR traded 0.14% lower against the USD and closed at 1.3062. The Euro started the week lower, as risk aversion increased, amid disappointing Chinese data, and following news that the newly founded Alternative for Germany, is gaining strength.

Losses were also trimmed after the Bundesbank President, Jens Weidmann stated that rate cuts in the region were only possible if data worsened, providing support to the Euro. On the macro front, the ZEW indicator of economic sentiment index in Germany declined to 36.3 in April, while the current economic situation index declined to a reading of 9.2 in April.

GBP USD

In the last week, GBP traded 0.73% lower against the USD and closed at 1.5232, after unemployment rate in the UK rose to 7.9% in March from 7.8% in February.

Additionally, minutes of the last BoE meeting showed that policymakers remained split over monetary policy, with only three out of nine policy members voting to increase bond buying program. On Friday, the Pound tanked 0.33% against the greenback, after Fitch Ratings stripped UK's long-term foreign and local currency issuer default ratings one step to "AA+" from "AAA". The pair traded at a high of 1.5386 and a low of 1.5216 in the previous week. GBPUSD is expected to find its first support at 1.5170, with the next at 1.5108. Resistance exists first at 1.5340, and then at 1.5448.

The gross domestic product in the UK to be released later this week, is likely to set tone for the pair, as market participants would check whether the data managed to dodge contraction in Q12013 and escape a triple dip recession.

USD JPY

The USD traded 0.66% higher against the JPY over the past week, closing at 99.55. The Yen found support after trade balance logged the narrowest deficit for nine months, at ¥362.4 billion in March, from a downwardly revised deficit of ¥779.5 billion in February.
