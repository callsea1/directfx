The Euro ended the week in positive territory against the greenback despite experiencing a string of negative news flow during the week. The Standard and Poor’s rating agency warned that France should deliver its proposed budget cuts to protect its “AAA” rating. Economic data released from the region was also uninspiring.
The Bank of Canada kept interest rates unchanged at 1.00% and indicated that current stimulus program is appropriate for the time being. The currency retreated against the dollar, despite better than expected economic growth in the nation. 
In the last week, the movements in the Japanese Yen was heavily influenced by the debt market after Japan’s government bond yields jumped to the highest level in a year. This raised fears about the flexibility of the central bank in providing further stimulus. The currency gave up some gains in the middle of the week after the advisor to the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Koichi Hamada stated that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) would provide further stimulus, if necessary, to drive an economic revival.
In addition, the forex markets were influenced by weak growth forecasts with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cutting its Chinese growth forecast to 7.75% for 2013, citing a feeble global economy. On global front, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) trimmed its forecasts for the world’s economy to 1.9% in 2013, lower than the 2.0% growth estimated earlier.
Sentiment in the commodity market was mixed with gold leading gains amid uncertainty regarding the probable curtailing of the US Federal Reserve’s QE3 program and on expectations for unprecedented demand for gold from Asian countries. Crude Oil traded weak, with reports indicating a record high growth in inventories and fragile global economic outlook.

During last week, the International Monetary Fund stated that it supports the Bank of Japan’s initiatives to reach its proposed 2% inflation goal through “sweeping enhancements” to its monetary-policy framework. Meanwhile, the National consumer price inflation figures in Japan recorded a 0.7% drop annually in the month of April, while the Tokyo Core CPI posted a gain for the first time in almost two years.

Statistics Canada reported that the nation’s GDP expanded by 0.2% in March, above expectations for a 0.1% increase.

Forex Market Update
The greenback came under pressure initially in the last week after the Federal Reserve officials, James Bullard and William Dudley, backed the central bank’s asset buying program and stated that the current monetary easing is the best solution for the US economy.
However, on Wednesday, the US Dollar rallied against most of its peers, after the Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke opined that the central bank might begin discussing ways of scaling back its ultra loose policy stance in the next few meetings, if the domestic economy continues to sustain momentum. However, he expressed caution that cutting back the monetary easing too soon would harm the nation’s economy.
Following the Chairman Ben Bernanke testimony, the minutes of the Federal Reserve Bank’s (Fed) latest monetary policy meeting indicated that some policymakers were of the view that the central bank should begin unwinding its asset purchases programme as early as June.
The Euro paced gains against the US Dollar, as upbeat PMI data from the Euro zone raised hopes of a rebound in the region’s economic recovery. Adding to the positive tone, the German sentiment indices came in better than expected for June, further supporting the currency.
The outlook for Sterling remained clouded after weaker-than-expected inflation in the UK suggested more room for monetary easing by the Bank of England (BoE) to bring the economy back on track. The minutes of the latest BoE meeting reported that the board members remained split 6-3, voting in favor of holding the benchmark interest rate at 0.5%. However, the Sterling pared some of its losses after GDP data confirmed that the UK economy managed to dodge a triple dip recession for the first quarter of 2013.
In Japan, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) left monetary policy unchanged at its policy meeting, as widely expected. The bank also upgraded its economic outlook, saying growth had started picking up.
Over the weekend, the minutes released by BoJ for the April 26 meeting, revealed that board members had considerable differences in opinion over the stimulus plans. Some of the members cautioned that bold easing measures could have unwarranted side effects including a rise in borrowing costs.
Separately, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) Chief, Thomas Jordan, indicated that the central bank could impose negative interest rates if required. Meanwhile Moody's Investors Service affirmed the Swiss sovereign debt at “Aaa”, and kept the outlook “Stable”.

Sentiment towards the commodity currencies soured further after data showed that manufacturing activity in China contracted for the first time in seven months in May.

EUR USD
Last week, the EUR traded 0.82% higher against the USD and closed at 1.2933. The European Central Bank (ECB) President, Mario Draghi stated that the economic conditions in the Euro-zone are challenging and he is ready to cut borrowing costs further, if the economic outlook worsens. The Euro rose after trade surplus in the Euro-zone widened more-than-expected in March to €25.9 billion as compared to a surplus of €14.6 billion recorded in the previous month. Also, manufacturing PMI activity indices in France, Germany and Euro-zone slightly rose in May, but remained in the contraction territory.

Economic releases taking center stage during this week includes unemployment rate and consumer price index from the Euro-zone.

GBP USD
In the last week, GBP traded 0.23% lower against the USD and closed at 1.5136, as uncertainty over whether the Federal Reserve would scale back its easing program this year supported the greenback. The outlook for Sterling remained fragile after weaker-than-expected inflation data in the UK suggested more room for monetary easing by the Bank of England (BoE) to bring the economy back on track. Also, retail sales in the UK declined 1.3% (MoM) in April, while public sector net borrowing rose by £8.0 billion in April. Meanwhile, the minutes of the latest BoE meeting revealed that 6 out of 9 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members voted unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at a record low 0.5%.

The pair traded at a high of 1.5283 and a low of 1.5014 in the previous week.

USD JPY

On Thursday, the Moody's affirmed Switzerland’s “Aaa” rating with a “Stable” outlook, citing the government’s high economic and financial strength.

Separately, the minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) latest monetary policy meeting indicated that the board members felt that it was appropriate to trim the nation's benchmark interest rate in order to spur economic growth, citing a benign inflation outlook, sustained strength in the Aussie and slowdown in mining business.

Weekly Forex Update
The US Dollar extended its winning streak for the week ending May 17, closing at its strongest level in nearly three years against other major currencies, on broad optimism over the strength of the US economy and amid growing anticipation that the Federal Reserve will move to wind down its bond-buying program.
During the week, the greenback came under some selling pressure on Thursday, following a rise in US weekly jobless claims, mixed signals from the housing market, and data showing a contraction in Philadelphia region’s manufacturing activity in May. However, the USD rebounded after San Francisco Federal Reserve President, John Williams opined that the Fed could slow the pace of buying $85 billion a month in bonds, possibly as early as the summer if the economy expands in line with forecasts.
The greenback extended its gains on Friday, after a bigger-than-expected increase in the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index signaled a better outlook for consumer spending in the US. Also, the Conference Board’s leading economic index rose in April to its highest level in nearly five years.
Ahead in the week, markets are expected to keep an eye on US durable goods order data, wherein a positive reading would support the case for an earlier withdrawal of monetary easing by the Fed. Additionally, existing and new home sales data for April due later this week will provide insights into the state of the nation’s housing market. Investors will closely scrutinize the minutes of the FOMC meeting and the Fed Chief, Ben Bernanke’s testimony later in the week, for cues on the central bank’s policy stance going forward.
The Euro lost ground against the US Dollar as a lack of decisive triggers prompted investors to adopt a cautious approach. Economic data in the Euro-zone was very weak, as GDP and PMI numbers continued to miss market expectations. Recent comments from the European Central Bank policymakers regarding negative deposit rates also proved to be a dampener for the Euro.
In the UK, jobless claims declined for April, while the unemployment rate unexpectedly slipped for the three months ended March. The BoE Governor, Mervyn King, in his last quarterly inflation report before he is set to be succeeded by Mark Carney in July 2013, predicted that UK’s growth would be faster and inflation lower than what was expected three months earlier, though he still warned that the recovery could not be taken for granted.
The Australian Dollar staged a sharp decline against the greenback on dismal economic data in China, Australia’s largest trading partner, and after the Australian Treasurer, Wayne Swan stated that the nation would grow 2.75% over the next year, less than the earlier forecast for 3.0%.
The Canadian Dollar registered heavy losses on Friday, after economic data showed that Canada's annual inflation rate fell sharply in April, far below expectations and well below the Bank of Canada's target range, boosting the case for relaxing monetary policy.

EUR USD
Last week, the EUR traded 1.15% lower against the USD and closed at 1.2839, hovering near its recent lows, amid speculation that the ECB was checking banks’ preparedness to handle a potential cut in its deposit rates to below zero. Also, ECB board members, Joerg Asmussen and Benoit Couere, indicated that monetary policy will remain accommodative. Investors also added favorable bets on the dollar, as debate over whether the Federal Reserve would wind down its asset buying programme later this year gathered pace. Economic data released in Europe was also not inspiring, with economic activity across the region falling by 0.2% in the first three months of 2013, while inflation in the 17-nation region fell 0.1% in April, slowest in three years.

During the week, the pair traded at a high of 1.3029 and a low of 1.2797. The pair is expected to find its first support at 1.2748, with the next support expected at 1.2656. The first resistance is at 1.2980 and the next at 1.3120.

GBP USD
Despite upbeat jobless claims data in the UK and unexpected decline in the nation’s unemployment rate, the GBP slipped 1.23% against the USD in the last week, closing at 1.5169, as comments from the US Fed policymakers continued to signal that a withdrawal of the current monetary stimulus remains on the cards, dragging high yield currencies lower. During the week, the Bank of England (BoE) Governor, Mervyn King offered some good news for the British economy, after the central bank predicted in its quarterly inflation report that the nation’s growth would be faster and inflation lower than it had expected three months earlier. The pair traded at a high of 1.5385 and a low of 1.5158 in the previous week. GBPUSD is expected to find its first support at 1.5090, with the next at 1.5010. Resistance exists first at 1.5317, and then at 1.5464.

A raft of key economic releases from the UK due this week will provide further insights into the pace of the nation’s recovery. Traders would also keenly focus on the BoE minutes due this week. Given an improvement in economic data released in recent weeks, it would be interesting to see if the minutes show a less dovish voting pattern.

USD JPY
The USD traded 1.56% higher against the JPY over the past week, closing at 103.21. The Yen lost steam against the US Dollar as prospects for the Bank of Japan to maintain its accommodative stance for a longer period rose, after Japan escaped criticism about its aggressive monetary easing programme at the G-7 finance ministers meeting. Meanwhile, the greenback rallied during the last week, in part due to speculation that the Federal Reserve might terminate its current round of quantitative easing, amid signs of an improved economic landscape in the US. However, the Yen registered handsome gains on Thursday, after Japanese first quarter GDP data surpassed market estimates, providing a boost to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's reform efforts. The pair traded at a high of 103.31 and a low of 101.26. The pair is expected to find its first support at 101.88, with the next support expected at 100.54. The first resistance is at 103.93 and the next at 104.64.

In the week ahead, investors will be focusing on Bank of Japan’s interest rate decision to be followed by the press conference by Governor Haruhiko Kuroda.

USD CHF
USD traded 1.66% higher against the CHF and closed at 0.9727 in the last week, as traders continued to increase their positions in the greenback on rising perceptions that the US Federal Reserve is getting closer to taper its existing bond buying program. On the economic front, real retail sales in Switzerland dropped 0.9% (YoY) in March, following a revised 2.3% increase recorded in the previous month. Additionally, the Swiss ZEW survey indicator for economic expectations fell sharply to a reading of 2.2 in May, compared to a reading of 20.0 in the previous month. Market had expected it to rise to 25.0 in May. During the period, the pair traded at a high of 0.9761 and a low of 0.9521. The first support is at 0.9578, and the next at 0.9430. Resistance exists first at 0.9818, and then at 0.9910.

With not much on the domestic economic calendar during the week, the direction of the Swiss Franc is likely to be determined by external factors.

USD CAD
Last week, the USD traded 1.79% higher against the CAD and closed at 1.0281, drawing support from comments by Federal Reserve policymakers who indicated that the Fed could curtail its easing program sooner than anticipated. The losses in the Canadian Dollar aggravated on Friday, after softer-than-expected domestic inflation data led investors away from the Loonie. Canada's consumer price index contracted 0.2% (MoM) in April from March, defying expectations for a 0.1% gain. The country's core CPI rose 0.1%, less than market expectations for a 0.2% gain, sparking speculation that the Bank of Canada has room to trim interest rates if need be.

USDCAD traded at a high of 1.0313 and a low of 1.0082 in the previous week. The first support is at 1.0138, with the next at 0.9994. The first resistance is at 1.0369, while the next is at 1.0456.

AUD USD
AUD tumbled 2.94% against the USD in the last week, and closed at 0.9730, on disappointing economic data from China, uninspiring domestic federal budget and amid broad strength in the US Dollar. The Australian Dollar witnessed sharp selling pressure, after the Australian Treasurer, Wayne Swan, in his federal budget, indicated that the nation is likely to register a $19.2 billion deficit for the current financial year largely affected by a slowdown in mining activity. During the week, the pair traded at a high of 1.0011 and a low of 0.9711. The first support is at 0.9624 and the next at 0.9517. The first resistance is at 0.9924 and the next at 1.0117.

Ahead this week, data on leading economic indicators and Westpac consumer confidence data is due for release. Traders are likely to focus on the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA’s) minutes of its most recent policy setting meeting.

Gold
In the prior week, Gold plummeted 6.18% against the USD and closed at USD1359.55, on growing speculation that the Federal Reserve could soon begin to rein in its bond-buying program. Also, data released on Friday showed that the US consumer sentiment hit an almost six-year high in early May, further supporting the view that the Fed could curtail its easing program earlier than previously estimated. Additionally, physical demand for the precious metal showed signs of softening.

The yellow metal traded at a high of 1445.57 and a low of 1355.60 in the previous week. Gold is expected to find support at 1328.24 and the next at 1296.94. The first resistance is at 1418.21, while the next is at 1476.88.

Crude Oil
Oil prices traded almost flat against the USD in the last week to close at USD96.02. Oil prices started the week on a negative note, weighed by concerns over weakening demand in China after nation’s industrial production rose at a slower pace in April. Oil prices also came under pressure, after the International Energy Agency (IEA) indicated that crude oil supply would surge through 2018. However, crude oil prices recouped its losses on rising Middle East concerns after an unsuccessful meeting between United Nations’ nuclear agency officials and Iranian representatives to allow the former to investigate a suspected atomic bomb research, leaving the ongoing diplomacy talks in deadlock. Oil prices climbed further on Friday, supported by a raft of strong economic data from the US. On the inventory front, the Energy Information Administration reported that crude oil inventories declined by 624,000 barrels for the week ended May 10, after the American Petroleum Institute (API) reported one day earlier that crude oil inventories rose more-than-expected by 1.11 million barrels in the week ending May 10.

Oil traded at a high of 96.45 and a low of 92.13 in the previous week. Oil has its first major support at 93.28, while the next support exists at 90.55. The first resistance is at 97.60 and the next at 99.19.

Meanwhile, comments by the European Central Bank (ECB) Chief, that he is open to negative interest rates in a bid to encourage banks to lend, played on traders mind as the Euro declined sharply against the USD and the other peers. Moreover, the ECB trimmed its 2013 GDP estimate to a contraction of 0.4% from a flat reading expected previously. The central bank also slashed the GDP growth estimate for 2014 to 1.0% from 1.1% estimated previously.
In the UK, industrial and manufacturing production rose more-than-estimated in March, while the NIESR estimates revealed that the Britain's economy gathered pace in the three months to April, the fastest since September last year. However the agency pointed out that the underlying growth is weaker. Meanwhile, in contrast to the major global central banks adopting aggressive stimulus measures, the Bank of England (BoE) maintained its asset-purchase program at £375 billion ($581 billion) and kept interest rates at a record low.
The Aussie Dollar and the Kiwi Dollar fell sharply against the greenback after central banks in both countries took steps to curb strength in their currencies earlier in the week. The New Zealand Dollar slumped 2.8% for the week, after the Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Graeme Wheeler, on Wednesday indicated that the central bank had intervened in the foreign exchange market amid concerns over the strength of its currency. Meanwhile, the week witnessed unexpected interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of Korea.

EUR USD
Last week, the EUR traded 0.96% lower against the USD and closed at 1.2983. The latest cut in benchmark interest rates by the ECB and the hint of further possible easing, coupled with the ECB chief’s comment that the central bank was prepared for negative rates if required proved a dampener for the Euro. Also, revised services PMI data released in Europe showed that the region continued to remain in contraction territory, though the extent of contraction reduced in April. The common currency however rebounded during middle of the week after the release of upbeat German factory orders data, successful bond auctions in Portugal and inspiring Chinese trade data. The Euro again fell later, as the greenback enjoyed support stemming from Thursday's weekly data on jobless claims. During the week, the pair traded at a high of 1.3195 and a low of 1.2935. The pair is expected to find its first support at 1.2880, with the next support expected at 1.2778. The first resistance is at 1.3140 and the next at 1.3298.

Taking a look at this week’s economic calendar, apart from releases across the Atlantic, the Euro-zone’s preliminary data on first quarter gross domestic product and region’s consumer price inflation data would be the key to the EURUSD movement.

GBP USD
In the last week, GBP traded 1.36% lower against the USD and closed at 1.5354. On Friday, the Pound came under pressure after UK trade data disappointed while upbeat jobless claims in the US released on Thursday supported gains in the US Dollar. During last week, signs that the UK economy is gaining traction emerged after monthly industrial activity rose more than expected in March, while the nation’s trade deficit narrowed. Furthermore, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) estimated that the nation grew by 0.8% for the three months period ended April 2013. Also, the Bank of England maintained status quo on expected lines in its policy meeting during the previous week. The pair traded at a high of 1.5599 and a low of 1.5314 in the previous week. GBPUSD is expected to find its first support at 1.5246, with the next at 1.5137. Resistance exists first at 1.5531, and then at 1.5707.

Apart from UK economic data, the Bank of England’s quarterly inflation report and Governor Mervyn King’s speech following the release of the report would generate market interest.

USD JPY
The USD traded 2.52% higher against the JPY over the past week, closing at 101.54. The USDJPY pushed through the 100 level on Thursday and further strengthened on Friday, as the pair moved past the 101 mark in the morning Asian session. On Friday, the greenback was boosted against the yen after data from Japan’s Ministry of Finance revealed that domestic residents were net buyers of overseas assets in the two weeks to May 4, indicating that the Bank of Japan’s easing program has prompted investors to seek out higher yields overseas to compensate for lower yields on Japanese government bonds. The pair traded at a high of 102.00 and a low of 98.58. The pair is expected to find its first support at 99.42, with the next support expected at 97.29. The first resistance is at 102.83 and the next at 104.12.

Ahead in the week, investors would tap data from Japan on preliminary first quarter GDP, industrial production and machinery orders data.

USD CHF
USD rose 2.24% against the CHF and closed at 0.9570 in the last week. The Swiss Franc backtracked against the greenback and the Euro in initial trading, after data revealed that consumer confidence in Switzerland declined by more than expected for April. Moreover, an expected decline in the unemployment rate failed to provide confidence to Swiss Franc investors. Meanwhile, data released on Wednesday indicated that the Swiss economy continued to face deflationary pressures for April, providing adequate room to the Swiss National Bank to introduce additional easing measures.During the period, the pair traded at a high of 0.9629 and a low of 0.9333. The first support is at 0.9392, and the next at 0.9215. Resistance exists first at 0.9688, and then at 0.9807.

During this week, Swiss producer price inflation, a leading indicator of consumer inflation, as well as data on ZEW economic expectations and retail sales would remain on traders’ radar.

USD CAD
Last week, the USD traded 0.34% higher against the CAD and closed at 1.0114. The Loonie staged a sharp decline against its US counterpart on Friday, after data revealed that Canadian employers added fewer jobs than forecast in April, fuelling concern that the nation’s economic recovery is slowing.  Statistics Canada reported that net employment rose by 12,500 jobs and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 7.2%. Earlier during the week, economic data indicated that the pace of purchasing activity in the Canadian economy slowed more sharply than expected in April. USDCAD traded at a high of 1.0154 and a low of 1.0012 in the previous week. The first support is at 1.0033, with the next at 0.9951. The first resistance is at 1.0175, while the next is at 1.0235.

On the economic front, market awaits official data on consumer inflation and wholesale sales, a leading indicator of consumer spending scheduled for release later during the week. Investors also keenly await the release of the Bank of Canada’s quarterly review report ahead in the week.

AUD USD
The Aussie Dollar shed 2.96% against the USD in the last week, and closed at 1.0009, slipping below parity for the first time since June, dropping to as low as 99.61 US cents. Market participants reduced their exposure to the Australian Dollar, after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) lowered its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.75% in its monetary policy meeting held during the week. Also, the Australian central bank warned in a report on Friday that the country's decade-long mining boom is beginning to cool, which may result in more economic pain and higher unemployment going forward.  Traders speculated that this opens the door to more interest-rate cuts, which will further diminish the appeal of the domestic currency. During the week, the pair traded at a high of 1.0309 and a low of 0.9961. The first support is at 0.9877, and the next at 0.9745. The first resistance is at 1.0225 and the next at 1.0441.

With no major domestic data scheduled for release during the week, the AUD is expected to closely track economic data from China and the Europe for clarity on risk appetite among market participants.

Gold
In the prior week, Gold traded 1.47% lower against the USD and closed at USD1449.10, as the greenback strengthened, following better than expected labor market data in the US. The yellow metal traded at a high of 1479.07 and a low of 1419.71 in the previous week. Gold is expected to find support at 1419.52 and then at 1389.93. The first resistance is at 1478.88, while the next is at 1508.65.

In the week ahead, gold traders would keep an eye on a flurry of US economic reports, including data on retail sales, building permits, jobless claims as well as a closely watched report on consumer sentiment. Any improvement in the US economic data would further increase speculation of an early exit by the US Fed from its current monetary easing program.

Crude Oil
Oil prices traded 0.44% higher against the USD in the last week and closed at USD96.04, as smaller-than-expected rise in US crude inventories and strong trade data from China helped boost the outlook for oil demand. The US Energy Information Administration reported that crude supplies rose 230,000 barrels for the week ended May 3, against expectations for a 1.9 million-barrel climb. This rise was smaller than the 680,000-barrel increase reported by the American Petroleum Institute on late Tuesday. However, oil prices fell later in the week, after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reported increased output in April and maintained a flat forecast of global demand. In its April report, the OPEC forecast total average oil demand of 89.7 million barrels per day (bpd), up 0.8 million bpd from 2012, unchanged from its March projection. Also the agency reported that production increased to 30.46 million barrels per day in April, marking the highest level in five months and from 30.18 million bpd in March. Oil traded at a high of 97.17 and a low of 93.37 in the previous week.

Oil has its first major support at 93.88, while the next support exists at 91.73. The first resistance is at 97.68 and the next at 99.33.

Also PMI in Europe confirmed that manufacturing activity continue to be weak across the region despite being revised higher. In France borrowing costs fell after a successful bond auction, with the yield for its benchmark 10-year bond slipping to 1.81%.

Meanwhile, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development stated that Italy's economy would contract by more than expected this year and its public finances would deteriorate in 2013 and 2014.

The Bank of Japan (BoJ), in its minutes for the recently held monetary policy meeting, indicated that there was a broad consensus among board members that it was necessary for the central bank to take more aggressive monetary policy measures to stimulate the economy.

The Australian Dollar registered losses after manufacturing data in China came in less-than-expected in April, confirming a fragile recovery in China. Also, data revealed that, the number of building permits in Australia dropped in March, indicating a bleak forecast for construction activity in the nation.


EUR USD

Last week, the EUR traded 0.62% higher against the USD and closed at 1.3109.

In the mid week, the Euro plunged after the ECB cut the main refinancing rate by 25bps to 0.50% and as the ECB Chief, Mario Draghi hinted that the central bank has an open mind with regard to negative deposit rates. However the following day, the ECB member, Ewald Nowotny commented that the markets were “over-interpreting” the earlier statement on negative interest rates by the central bank Chief. This aided trading sentiment towards the Euro and helped the Euro in recovering its losses.

Adding to the positive tone, the UK manufacturing PMI improved to 49.8 in April from 48.6 in March. Further boosting sentiment, UK’s services sector recorded its strongest growth, adding to signs that the slow economic recovery may be gaining some traction.

 Weekly Forex Update

The greenback held an upper hand against its key counterparts, as uninspiring data from China early in the week rattled market sentiment. Chinese economic growth slowed unexpectedly in the first quarter of 2013, while industrial production came in lower than expected. Also, Moody's lowered China's credit outlook to 'Stable' from 'Positive', citing lack of necessary progress in reducing risks from local-government debt and credit expansion.

The gains in the Dollar were capped, after the Minneapolis Fed President, Narayana Kocherlakota, and the Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve (Fed), Janet Yellen, voiced support for continuation of monetary easing program. Meanwhile, economic data in the US was mixed.

The Euro started the week lower, as disappointing economic data from China dented investor sentiment. Additionally, reports that German political party, known as the Alternative for Germany, which intends to take Germany out of the Euro, is gaining support, further pushed the Euro lower. Also, the IMF forecasted the region's economy to shrink more than projected earlier. The Euro tumbled further, on back of dovish comments by the Bundesbank President, Jens Weidmann, that there was a possibility of an interest rate cut in the Euro-zone.

The commodity sensitive Canadian Dollar witnessed drop in the last week, after the Bank of Canada (BoC) trimmed its forecast for the nation's economy.

GBP USD

In the last week, GBP traded 0.73% lower against the USD and closed at 1.5232, after unemployment rate in the UK rose to 7.9% in March from 7.8% in February.

USD JPY

The USD traded 0.66% higher against the JPY over the past week, closing at 99.55. The Yen found support after trade balance logged the narrowest deficit for nine months, at ¥362.4 billion in March, from a downwardly revised deficit of ¥779.5 billion in February.

Losses in the US dollar were capped after the minutes of Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) meeting held on 20th March, showed that policymakers remained divided over whether to continue with or wind-up the asset purchase program earlier. The minutes also showed that a number of FOMC members saw quantitative easing tapering around midyear and to stop by end of 2013. However, the greenback declined later again as upbeat US jobless claims data eased fears about deterioration in the US labor market and boosted risk appetite. However, losses were capped, as weak US macroeconomic data on Friday led by an unexpected decline in retail sales and a significant deterioration in consumer sentiment fuelled worries about the US economic recovery.
The Euro received a positive start to the week, as encouraging trade and current account balance data from Germany eased worries of recession in the region. Further supporting the shared currency was speculation that central banks across the world would continue with their monetary stimulus programmes to support economic growth.
